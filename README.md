## Auto-correlation and Cross-correlation

In this repository, I provide both Matlab code and Python code to demonstrate the cross-correlation between 2 sequences.

To confirm the correctness of my code, I compare the cross-correlation values obtained by using my user-defined functions with the Matlab's built-in function (aka xcorr).

It is shown that the results from my functions match up with the Matlab's result.
